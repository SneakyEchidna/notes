Hello. My name is Kanstantsin Kiyko and I'd like to present you a quick overview of github features.

Git have become one of the most popular version control systems.  Huge role in this have played services like github, which add extra infrastructure around simple github source control system.
#
Github popularizes a code review culture. 
Your team can create review processes that improve the quality of your code and fit neatly into your workflow.
#
Pull requests are fundamental to how teams review and improve code on GitHub. 

Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before the changes are merged into the repository.
#
Pull requests display diffs to compare the changes you made in your topic branch against the base branch that you want to merge your changes into.
#
You can browse commits, comments, and references related to your pull request in a timeline-style interface. Your pull request will also highlight what’s changed since you last checked.

Rather than viewing the commits themselves, you can view the proposed changes as they'll appear in the files once the pull request is merged. 

You can search your commit history by keyword, committer, organization, and more.
#
You can see what a file looked like before a particular change. With blame view, you can see how any portion of your file has evolved over time without viewing the file’s full history.
#
On GitHub, conversations happen alongside your code. Leave detailed comments on code syntax and ask questions about structure inline.
#
If you’re on the other side of the code, requesting peer reviews is easy. Add users to your pull request and they’ll receive a notification letting them know you need their feedback.
#
You can save your teammates a few notifications by bundling your comments into one cohesive review, then specify whether comments are required changes or just suggestions.
#
You can’t always avoid conflict. Merge pull requests faster by resolving simple merge conflicts on GitHub—no command line necessary.
#
Reviews can improve your code, but mistakes happen. You can limit human error and ensure only high quality code gets merged with detailed permissions and status checks.
#
Give collaborators as much access as they need through your repository settings. You can extend access to a few teams and select which ones can read or write to your files.
#
Protected Branches help you maintain the integrity of your code. You can limit who can push to a branch, and disable force pushes to specific branches.
#
Create required status checks to add an extra layer of error prevention on branches. Use the Status API to enforce checks and disable the merge button until they pass.
#
Review tools can be used to avoid human error and add extra polish to your team’s code.
#
On GitHub, project managers and developers coordinate, track and update their work in one place, so projects stay transparent and on schedule.
#
Create an issue to suggest a new idea enhancements, tasks or track a bug. Then organize and assign tasks to your team. 

You can open a new issue from a specific line or lines of code in a file or pull request.
#
Issue, comment and pull request descriptions support Markdown task lists—checklists you can use to coordinate and track parts of a project. Reorder tasks as your priorities change, and check them off as you complete each one.
#
Assign up to ten teammates to an issue or pull request to make sure work has an owner. Mentioning other people or teams in the issue will notify them if something changes. They can also stay in the loop by opting to receive notifications whenever someone posts a comment.
#
Tagging issues and pull requests with labels allows you to quickly search for them later. Filter your issues by label to find and reference all issues that are part of your project.
#
Add a milestone to track a project as part of a larger goal, like a quarterly to-do list or a big feature. Then watch your milestone’s overall progress from the milestone page.
#
Track updates to your project without complicating your workflow by crosslinking between issues and pull requests anywhere in your GitHub organization. If you associate an issue with a pull request, it will automatically close when the pull request is merged.
#
Project boards on GitHub help you organize and prioritize your work. You can create project boards for specific feature work, comprehensive roadmaps, or even release checklists. With project boards, you have the flexibility to create customized workflows that suit your needs.
#
Sort tasks into columns by status. You can label columns with status indicators like “In Progress,” “Up Next,” or “One Light Year from Now”.
#
There are a few ways to add your team’s to-dos to a column. Write notes on your tasks or search existing issues and pull requests, then add them as cards.
#
Each card has a unique URL, making it easy to share and discuss individual tasks with your team. If a note needs next steps, convert it into an issue from your project board.
#
The activity view helps you keep track of everything happening in your team’s project and see exactly what‘s changed since the last time you looked.
#
If you’ve completed a project, congrats! Close your project board to remove it from your active project list and wrap up your work.
#
You always can extend your project management process using tools that integrate with and build on GitHub issues and pull requests.
#
Github offers you a GitHub marketplace whe you can use  to fine tune your process as your team changes, update tools as technologies shift, and find new ways to work better.

And you can always create your own tools using GitHub API.
#
Building software is as much about managing teams and communities as it is about code. Whether you’re on a team of two or two thousand, we’ve got the support your people need.
#
Help people get organized with GitHub teams, level up access with administrative roles, and fine tune your permissions with nested teams.
#
Moderation tools, like issue and pull request locking, help your team stay focused on code. And if you maintain an open source project, user blocking reduces noises and ensures conversations are productive.
#
Set roles and expectations without starting from scratch. Customize common codes of conduct to create the perfect one for your project. Then choose a pre-written license right from your repository.
#
With a community of 24 million developers, there are plenty of opportunities to connect with like-minded developers and the projects they create.
#
Starring repositories lets maintainers know you appreciate their work and helps you track projects you don’t contribute to. Watch repositories to get notifications when someone opens an issue or submits a pull request.
#
You can get project recommendations in your news feed. And with Explore, you can browse curated collections, trending repositories, and popular topics.
#
Show the public activity and proud moments behind your green squares. Pin your best work to your profile or browse others’ timelines to see the projects they’ve shaped.
#
Quality documentation is a hallmark of any healthy software project. On GitHub, you can create well-maintained docs and make sure they receive the high level of care they deserve.

#
Quality documentation is a hallmark of any healthy software project. For open-source projects, however, maintaining a robust compendium of knowledge detailing all the ins and outs is paramount. Well-curated documentation increases your project’s approachability, provides asynchronous guidance, and fosters the type of uncoordinated collaboration that propels open-source software development.
GitHub Pages gives you a direct path to create websites for your projects, which makes it a natural choice for publishing and maintaining documentation.
Most importantly, using GitHub Pages means your documentation lives alongside your code on GitHub, where you can use things like Issues and Pull Requests to ensure it receives the high level of care it deserves;
#
Write documentation using the power of version control. Each wiki is its own repository, so every change is versioned and comparable. A text editor lets you easily add your docs in the text formatting language of your choice, like Textile or GitHub Flavored Markdown.
Just as writing good code and great tests are important, excellent documentation helps others use and extend your project.
Every GitHub repository comes equipped with a section for hosting documentation, called a wiki.
#
GitHub is one of the largest code hosts in the world with over 80 million* projects. Private, public, or open source, all repositories are equipped with tools to help you host, version, and release code.

Repositories help you keep code in one place, even if you use SVN or work with large files using Git LFS.
With unlimited private repositories included in all GitHub plans, you can create or import as many projects as you’d like.
#
When you’re ready to share, you can package your changes from a recently closed milestone or finished project into a new release.
#
All this features fit perfectly into current opensourse software model and help to develop older project and jumpstart new ones. So Github is wellknown for a reason.

That's all what I want to say today. 
Thanks for watching.
